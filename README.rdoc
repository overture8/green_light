= green_light {<img src="https://travis-ci.org/overture8/green_light.svg?branch=master" alt="Build Status" />}[https://travis-ci.org/overture8/green_light]

Provides client side validation, with the help of the {jquery validation plugin}[http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/].  Keeping validation in the model, where it belongs.


== Installation

Add green_light to your Gemfile and run the <tt>bundle install</tt> command.

  gem 'green_light'

== Usage

Include the JQuery validation plugin in your <tt>app/assets/javascripts/application.js</tt> file:-

  //= require jquery.validate

Since the validation rules are creating dynmically they need to be included in the header of your layout file:-

  <%= javascript_include_tag "green_light" %>

Add the <tt>green_light</tt> class to the forms that you wish to have client side validation:-

  <%= form_for(@model, :html => { :class => 'green_light' }) do |f| %>

And finally, add some validations to your models!


== Currently Supports these validations

  validates_presence_of
  validates_length_of
  validates_format_of
  validates_uniqueness_of
  validates_numericality_of

For validations that are not yet supported, the gem will degrade gracefully to the standard Rails server-side validation.


== Legacy Rails 3 Support

For Rails 3 support use the older version (0.0.3) of green_light


== Requirements

JQuery is require for the {jquery validation plugin}[http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/].  Be sure to include this in your <tt>application.js</tt> file:-

  //= require jquery


== Running the Tests

  bundle install
  bundle exec rspec spec
